# Flarum Composer Installer

This package is now obsolete and has no function.

Previously it was a [Custom Installer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/custom-installers.md) for Composer that placed Flarum extensions in an `extensions` directory. As of 0.1.0-beta.5, the `extensions` directory [has been removed](https://github.com/flarum/core/issues/774).
